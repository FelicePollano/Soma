# Soma
Soma is a game wrote for fun. Initial version was made in a weekend thanks to [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine in playn GDScript.
Soma is a Zuma inspired game, it features the following topics

- collision detection
- sprites
- audio source
- particle system
- custom physics implementation
- bugs

Soma is not supposed to be a professional game, it has a single level, it is ( at the moment ) a possibly good example in using Godot engine.

Feel free to help on doing this project/example better.
